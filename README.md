# Fitting Cox-DNN models
This is Python code for fittting Cox-DNN models for simulated data.
The fitting procedure is below.
1) Generation of simulated data
2) Fit Cox-DNN models using Cox-DNN and DeepSurv
Here, "Breslow loss function" is necessary for "Cox-DNN" and
"Brier Score" is also necessary for computing the Brier Score.
